*Nothing in the world can overcome persistence. Talent does not surpass. There is nothing more common than talented failures.
Genius does not overcome. The unknown genius is practically a cliché. Education does not surpass. The world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination are very powerful.

As much as it may seem like a fantasy, it is up to you to create your own future. The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can change their lives by changing their way of thinking. ?? As Emerson stated: a man is what he thinks all day long”*
